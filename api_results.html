  "strategy": "Given the client's moderate risk tolerance and medium risk capacity, a balanced portfolio is suggested. A significant portion is invested in large-cap stocks (35%) due to their stability and consistent returns over the long-term. Mid-cap and small-cap stocks are riskier and hence comprise a smaller portion of the portfolio (10% and 5% respectively). Given the client's concerns about market volatility and inflation, 20% is recommended to be invested in both government bonds, which provide stable returns, and corporate fixed deposits, which offer higher interest rates. Mutual funds are another diversified investment option proposed at 5%. Lastly, gold ETFs are included at 5% for their hedge against inflation and diversification benefits."
